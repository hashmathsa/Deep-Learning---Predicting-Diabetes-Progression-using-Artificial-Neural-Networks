**Objective:**

The aim is to create a model that predicts the progression of diabetes using various independent variables. This model will be invaluable for healthcare professionals as it helps elucidate how different factors influence diabetes progression. Such insights could guide better treatment planning and preventive strategies.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this purpose is the Diabetes dataset available in the `sklearn` library.The dataset consists of 442 samples, each with 10 normalized features. These features include age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure indicating the progression of diabetes one year after the baseline measurement.

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

The dataset was obtained and underwent necessary preprocessing, including the handling of missing values, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

**2. Model Development:**

An initial neural network model was constructed with a basic architecture. The model was trained using the training dataset, and its performance was assessed on the test dataset.

**3. Model Improvement:**

To enhance the model's learning capability, an extra hidden layer was added to the architecture. The Adam optimizer was utilized with a reduced learning rate to improve convergence. Additionally, early stopping was implemented to mitigate overfitting during the training process.

**4. Performance Evaluation:**

The performance of the improved model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. The results of the improved model were compared against the original model's performance.

**Conclusion:**

The improved model demonstrated superior performance relative to the original model. The Mean Squared Error decreased, and the R² Score increased, indicating a better fit to the data. The enhancements made, including the additional hidden layer, the use of the Adam optimizer with a lower learning rate, and early stopping, contributed significantly to these improvements.
